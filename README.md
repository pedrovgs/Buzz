#  <img alt="Buzz" src="./src/baseComponents/logo/images/logo.svg" height="80" width="80"/> Buzz [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/Buzz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pedrovgs/Buzz)

A portable photo booth built on top of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

### Running this project:

This repository is built on top of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for dependency management. Thanks to these tools you can easily run this project on your computer running the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn run dev // Starts a webpack-dev-server instance with our react application inside and the electron app showing this applicaiton. This command is ideal for development purposes.
yarn start // Starts a webpack-dev-server instance with our react application running on a browser.
```

### Configuring this project:

This project uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) in order to sing in the user and upload the pictures so if you want to build a custom version of this project you'll need to follow the following steps. Without a Firebase project associated you won't be able to run the project properly.

Steps to create a Firebase account:

* Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a project.
* After creating a project, click on "Add Firebase to your web app".
* Go to the authentication menu and enable Google as an authenticator provider.
* Back to the application screen copy the config values you'll see if you tap on the button named "Add Firebase to your web application". You should the following config values:

```javascript
var config = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyAFF1HzzasdffNzysOQqKbNfm4K7Wtasdf",
    authDomain: "my-app.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://my-app.firebaseio.com",
    projectId: "my-app",
    storageBucket: "my-app.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "123240264111"
}
```

* Paste the previously copied values into a file named ``.env.development`` and ``.env.production`` inside root folder as follows:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSasfd1HzzpgX6fNzysOQqKbNfm4K7Wtasdf"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="my-app.firebaseapp.com"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="https://my-app.firebaseio.com"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="my-app"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="my-app.appspot.com"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="123240261111"
```

You can find a complete guide explaining how to do configure the Firebase project [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin).

### Executing tests:

This project contains some tests written using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). You can easily run the tests by executing one of the following commands:

```
yarn test // Executes every test inside the src folder.
yarn buildForTests // Builds the app for testing purposes. Needed before executing the screenshot tests
yarn verifyScreenshotTests // Executes every test in record mode.
yarn recordScreenshotTests // Executes every test in record mode.
yarn test --watch // Watch files for changes and rerun tests related to changed files.
yarn test --watchAll // Watch files for changes and rerun every test.
yarn test --testRegex "String calculator spec*" //Executes tests matching with the regex passed as param.
```

This repository contains some tests written using a testing strategy named [visual regression testing](https://www.phase2technology.com/blog/new-and-exciting-area-front-end-development-regression-testing) or [screenshot testing](https://github.com/Karumi/Shot/). Under the hood, we are using [spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron) and [jest-image-snapshot](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot) in order to run the app, take the screenshot and compare them with the baseline images. **However, a library used by ``jest-image-snapshot`` is not compatible with ``node-9`` so we need to force ``node-8`` to be able to run our tests. Sorry for the inconveniences, [here](https://github.com/lukeapage/pngjs/issues/95) you can find more information about the bug. And [here](https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot/issues/31) the original issue named: Image comparison of snapshots crashes node v9.2.0.**

The rest of the tests in this repository are placed inside the ``src`` folder and are regular unit and integration tests.

### Linter:

This repository uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) in order to check if the js code written matches the checkstyle configured. You can check if everything is ok by executing ``yarn lint`` and automatically fix the issues by executing ``yarn fixLint`` if needed.
